 - Draft pull requests should be properly identified as [draft pull requests](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) to avoid confusions.
 - When modifying/coding, please follow the guidelines below:

## Coding:
 - As a repository standard, every function and variable name should use camelCase.
   - Correct usage: `updatesCount = 0`, `def searchForUpdates(packageManager):`
   - Incorrect usage: `updates_count = 0`, `def searchforupdates(package_manager):`
 - Constants should be written in capital letters, using underscores for spaces:
   - Example: `SYSTEM_DEFAULT_LOCALE = "ca-ES"`
 - Please specify, when possible, variable data types and function return types. More info [here](https://python.plainenglish.io/specifying-data-types-in-python-c182fda3bf43)
 - Try to add spaces and empty newlines to make code more human readable.
 - 
## Commits:
 - Commits must include only changes on one feature or section of the code. Let's say, you have fixed an issue regarding localisation and added a new entry in the settings section to change update frequency, those two changes must be committed separately.
 - The code in each commit should be executable. Please do not leave work unfinished across commits, or, if it is needed, let the code be executed without errors.
 - Commit names must be clear and self-explanatory, and, if applicable, must reference the corresponding issue
